Work by Paul Lerner under Laurence Likforman-Sulem supervision.

# Dependencies
- PyTorch
- Sci-kit learn
- NumPy

# Model
The code allows to choose between GRU and LSTM
(just change the model name in model definition, they have the same hyperparameters). The forget gate bias will be init to 1 only if the model is LSTM.
